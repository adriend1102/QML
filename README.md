# QAFIC

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for the final bachelor's project in Computer Engineering at the Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB) titled "Quantum Algorithms For Image Classification" This project explores the exciting intersection of quantum computing and machine learning to tackle image classification tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the code in this repository, you will need the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of quantum computing and machine learning.
- Python 3.10 or higher (lower versions may also work well, but we will not support them).
- Access to a quantum computing platform or simulator (e.g., IBM Qiskit, Google Cirq).
- Required Python libraries, which can be installed using `pip`:
```
pip install qiskit qiskit-machine-learning numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: This directory contains the image datasets used for training and testing.
- `docs/`: Project documentation and presentation files.
- `models/`: Implementations of quantum and classical machine learning models.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the experiments and results.
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `.gitignore`: Github .gitignore file to get rid of annoying files.
- `LICENSE.txt`: The project's license file.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## Usage

To replicate the experiments or use the implemented models, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/adriend1102/QML.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd <directory_where_the_cloned_repository_is_located>
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory to explore the experiments and results.

4. Use the code and models in the `models/` directory for your image classification tasks.
